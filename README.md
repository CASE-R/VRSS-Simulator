# VRSS Simulator in Unity
***
## Preface
This repository contains the reworked Virtual Reality Solar System (VRSS) Simulator from a [Final Year Project](https://github.com/CASE-R/VR-SolarSystem-UNITY) during a paid summer placement.

In the event the simulator is further developed, this repo can be shared/forked/handed over to future developers.

## Project Overview
This VRSS Simulator will act as an educational tool to teach Newtonian Gravity in an interactive manner using the Unity Engine and it's VR-support capabilities. This involves realtime customised gravity and orbits that can be disrupted at any given time, whilst also grabbing, throwing and editing orbiting bodies creating a Zero-G Sandbox environment.
